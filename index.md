## Artificial Intelligence for Predictive Maintenance

### Description of the Symposium

Complex, physical systems degrade over time, and continued maintenance is required to ensure their peak performance.
Upkeep of well-engineered systems is often straightforward, yet significant challenges lie in knowing when and what to maintain.
Traditional approaches to managing maintenance activities rely on scheduled or condition-based approaches.
Predictive Maintenance (PMx) paradigm complements them with the ability to forecast needs into the future, reducing monetary and logistical burden of ownership, boosting operational safety, and reducing system down-time due to unexpected failures.
Past successes show that PMx is capable of achieving those goals, however, there are remaining challenges and untapped opportunities in applying this technology at-scale in real-world settings.
Many of these outstanding issues can be resolved with Artificial Intelligence.

This symposium aims to bring together researchers and practitioners across academia, industry, and government in order to discuss challenges, approaches, and needs in the field of AI-driven PMx, as well as fuel collaborative efforts which will accelerate the progress of adopting AI across entire organizations that maintain critical systems.

### Topic Areas Include (but are not limited to)

- **Readying maintenance, logistics, and/or systems data for AI**
    - Work on curating, cleaning, featurizing, annotating, and/or sketching complex data from critical systems.
- **Analytical frameworks for critical system prognostics**
    - Work on defining predictive tasks and applying various modeling paradigms to support prognostics
- **Impact assessments of AI-driven Predictive Maintenance**
    - Work on defining metrics of success and translating AI evaluation metrics (e.g., accuracy) into business and operational metrics (e.g., reduced down-time).
- **Implementation Strategies**
    - Work on implementation of research and development in practice.
- **Using AI to maintain peak operation of cyber-physical systems**

### Symposium Format
The symposium will feature poster sessions along with sessions of talks, organized by topic area, to present submitted work.  AI for PMx is intended to be an **in-person** event.  More details will be posted here as they become available.
